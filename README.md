# Turbo Clash

## Description

Experience the ultimate thrill ride in this exhilarating game that combines vehicular combat with lightning-fast sports action, reminiscent of the adrenaline-fueled excitement of Rocket League. Engage in matches where turbo boosters and strategic maneuvers are your keys to victory in electrifying arenas. Outsmart your opponents and score the most goals to emerge victorious in this adrenaline-packed showdown. 
You can win points by scoring (5 points) or by catching coins (1 point). The first to 20 points wins! There is both a single player mode against an AI or play with friends in split screen view. Catch the purple powerups (speed and ball attract effects) to gain the edge!
