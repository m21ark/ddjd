Theme - 1 (Furious Soccer)

Project Name - TurboClash

Project Brief Description (less than 3 paragraphs):

    - Single Player with eventual MultiPlayer if time allows it
    - We'll try 3D but may roll back to 2D if it is proven too difficult
    - Very inspired in Rocket League. So cars can also jump for more interesting playing experience

Forseen Challenges:

    - Car steering mechanics and physics 
    - PC Rival AI
    - Multiple interactive menus

Game Engine - Unity


2 powerups:
    - super kick
    - speed turbo
    - ability to break obstacles

2 obstacles:
    - breakable/movable obstacle 
    - indestructible/fixed obstacle
    - speed hops 
    - bouncy tiles  
    - moving obstacles


Random ideas:
    - have dynamic arenas that change with time or are random
    - have different car types, with different attributes for speed, steering, defense, weight, appearance ... 
    - cars may have an ultimate move that may vary (speed, invulnerabilty, phase through obstacles, teleport, mega kick, magnet on the ball, area stun enemy)
    - weather effects like snow, rain, wind that effect cars and the ball
    - different kinds of balls (size, weight, bouncyness etc)
    - can also add a brawl effect than cars can attack eachother and damage them temporarly, limiting their speed for example
